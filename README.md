# Simple & Modern

A HTML5 Windows Manager written in Javascript. Easy to integrate, easy to setup.

During my formative years, I developed a strong aversion to the constant surveillance of our computer activities within the school environment. The fact that every minute online action was being monitored bothered me. This discontentment led me to conceive DuckOS, an innovative Operating System designed to function entirely within a web browser. A key component of this endeavor is `browserdesk.js`, a meticulously crafted, compiled windowing system that offers seamless setup. All of this is achieved using static and pure JavaScript, free from unnecessary complexities.

## I'm interested. How do I use?

You can easily set up browserdesk.js by simply adding this code to before the closing body tag:

```html
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GikitSRC/browserdesk.js/main/browserdesk.js"></script>
```

And add this anywhere before the closing </head> tag:

```html 
<link href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GikitSRC/browserdesk.js/main/browserdesk.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```

## Creating Windows

Instructions to create, add, remove, minimize, maximize windows are inside the browserdesk.js file.
